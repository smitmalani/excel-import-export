# Backend Application Database Configuration
# These values should typically match those used by docker-compose for the MySQL service,
# as defined in the root .env file.

DB_HOST=localhost
# When your backend runs outside Docker, it connects to localhost and the mapped MySQL port.
# If your backend runs as another Docker container on the same docker-compose network,
# you would use the service name (e.g., mysql_db) as the host and port 3306 directly.

DB_PORT=3306 # This should match the MYSQL_PORT you set in the root .env file for docker-compose
DB_DATABASE=loyalty_program_db # This should match MYSQL_DATABASE from the root .env
DB_USER=loyalty_user # This should match MYSQL_USER from the root .env
DB_PASSWORD=your_app_db_password_here # Replace with the actual password in your backend/.env file

# Add other backend-specific environment variables below
# مثلاً:
# APP_ENV=development
# APP_PORT=3010
# SECRET_KEY=your_application_secret_key
